Haynes, Jonathan Ryan, 40, passed unexpectedly on Thursday, June 30, 2022, in Tampa, Florida, where he resided for the last 15 years. Jonathan was born in St. Louis, Missouri on August 23, 1981, graduated from Parkway South High School in 1999, and received his Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from the University of Southern Florida. The world is emptier without his wit, thoughtfulness, and unbridled charm.

Jonathan was a loving and deeply caring son, brother, uncle, and friend. He was an exceptionally talented athlete and extraordinarily passionate about sportsâ€”especially baseball, football, and deep-sea diving. He had boundless potential and was a collector of tools, lover of cars, a skilled chef, and was deeply knowledgeable about biochemistry and medicine. Above all, Jonathan was a devoted lover of animals, particularly for his two puppies Pooh Bear and Pandora, who preceded him in death.

Jonathan was the beloved son of Barry and Elizabeth Haynes of Riverview, Florida, the cherished brother of Brandon Haynes (Stacey) of Seattle, Washington, loving uncle of Sterling Haynes, and proud godfather to Lillian Visser. He was preceded in death by his grandparents Robert and Ova Lowrey, grandparents Vallie and Mildred Haynes, and uncle Michael Haynes. Jonathan is survived by his uncles Charles Lowrey (Beverly) of Ruskin, Florida and Kenneth Lowrey Sr. (Mary Ann) of Mason, Ohio, Aunt Bennie Haynes of Memphis, Tennessee, countless cousins and close friends.

A Memorial service will be held in Tampa, Florida on August 21, 2022. We love you, Jon!
